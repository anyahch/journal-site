Netlify CMS is adaptable to a wide variety of projects. The only inflexible requirement is that your site content must be written in markdown, JSON, YAML, or TOML files, stored in a repo on GitHub. (If you’re partial to another Git hosting service, check out the PRs in progress for GitLab and Bitbucket support.)

This tutorial will guide you through the steps for adding Netlify CMS to a site that’s built with a common static site generator, like Jekyll, Hugo, Hexo, or Gatsby. Alternatively, you can start from a template or dive right into to configuration options.
